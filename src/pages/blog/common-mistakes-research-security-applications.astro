					<h2>The High Cost of Application Errors</h2>
					<p>Before diving into specific mistakes, let's understand why getting your application right the first time matters:</p>

					<div class="cost-grid">
						<div class="cost-item">
							<div class="cost-icon">⏰</div>
							<div class="cost-content">
								<h4>Time Delays</h4>
								<p>Each round of corrections adds 2-4 weeks to processing time. Multiple errors can extend timelines by months.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="cost-item">
							<div class="cost-icon">💰</div>
							<div class="cost-content">
								<h4>Funding Impact</h4>
								<p>Delayed certifications can hold up grant submissions, potentially costing you competitive funding opportunities.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="cost-item">
							<div class="cost-icon">🔍</div>
							<div class="cost-content">
								<h4>Increased Scrutiny</h4>
								<p>Applications with errors often trigger more intensive review, even for sections that were initially correct.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="cost-item">
							<div class="cost-icon">😓</div>
							<div class="cost-content">
								<h4>Stress and Frustration</h4>
								<p>Back-and-forth corrections consume time and energy better spent on research.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="stat-box">
						<div class="stat-number">67%</div>
						<p>of first-time applications require at least one correction before approval</p>

					<h2>Category 1: Disclosure Errors</h2>
					<p>Disclosure mistakes are the most common—and often most serious—application errors. Here's what to watch for:</p>

					<div class="mistake-card critical">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity">Critical</span>
							<h3>Incomplete Foreign Activity Disclosure</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Omitting foreign appointments, visiting positions, or collaborations that don't involve direct payment.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Researchers often assume that only paid positions need to be disclosed, or they forget about informal arrangements made years ago.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Disclose ALL foreign affiliations, regardless of compensation</li>
									<li>Include honorary positions, visiting appointments, and advisory roles</li>
									<li>Review your CV and ORCiD record before completing disclosures</li>
									<li>When in doubt, disclose—reviewers can determine relevance</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="mistake-card critical">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity">Critical</span>
							<h3>Underreporting Current and Pending Support</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Failing to include all sources of research support, especially in-kind contributions, equipment access, or indirect funding.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Many researchers don't recognize certain forms of support as requiring disclosure, particularly when no money changes hands directly.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Include in-kind support: equipment, lab space, personnel, materials</li>
									<li>Report support from all sources: government, industry, foundations, foreign entities</li>
									<li>List pending applications, not just awarded funding</li>
									<li>Include internal institutional support and seed grants</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="mistake-card moderate">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity moderate">Moderate</span>
							<h3>Inconsistent Information Across Forms</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Providing different dates, amounts, or descriptions for the same activity on different disclosure forms.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Researchers complete multiple forms at different times without cross-referencing, or they estimate when exact information is available.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Maintain a master document with all disclosure information</li>
									<li>Use exact figures from official sources, not estimates</li>
									<li>Review all submitted forms together before finalizing</li>
									<li>Update all forms simultaneously when information changes</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="mistake-card moderate">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity moderate">Moderate</span>
							<h3>Outdated Time Commitment Information</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Reporting time commitments that don't add up correctly or that don't reflect actual current activities.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Project responsibilities evolve over time, and researchers don't update their commitment percentages to reflect changes.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Verify total commitments don't exceed 100% (or justified amount)</li>
									<li>Review and update commitments at least quarterly</li>
									<li>Account for teaching, administrative duties, and other obligations</li>
									<li>Be realistic about actual time spent on each activity</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

				<section>
					<h2>Category 2: Documentation Failures</h2>
					<p>Even accurate information can cause problems if not properly documented:</p>

					<div class="mistake-card moderate">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity moderate">Moderate</span>
							<h3>Missing or Expired Supporting Documents</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Submitting applications without required attachments or with outdated versions of supporting documents.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Requirements change over time, and researchers use old templates or forget that certain documents need annual renewal.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Review current requirements before each submission</li>
									<li>Check document dates and expiration requirements</li>
									<li>Maintain organized digital files of all supporting documents</li>
									<li>Set calendar reminders for document renewals</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="mistake-card minor">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity minor">Minor</span>
							<h3>Incorrect File Formats or Naming</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Submitting documents in wrong formats (e.g., Word instead of PDF) or with non-compliant file names.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Applicants don't read formatting requirements carefully or assume any format is acceptable.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Read all formatting and naming conventions before preparing documents</li>
									<li>Use required naming formats exactly as specified</li>
									<li>Convert documents to required formats before submission</li>
									<li>Test file accessibility after conversion</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="mistake-card moderate">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity moderate">Moderate</span>
							<h3>Inadequate Training Documentation</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Unable to provide evidence of completed security training or providing certificates that don't meet requirements.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Training completions aren't tracked systematically, or researchers complete training that doesn't satisfy specific requirements.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Save all training certificates immediately upon completion</li>
									<li>Verify training meets specific agency or program requirements</li>
									<li>Use centralized tracking systems like CSR certification</li>
									<li>Confirm training provider is recognized and approved</li>
								</ul>

					<h2>Category 3: ORCiD-Related Issues</h2>
					<p>As ORCiD becomes mandatory for research security applications, related errors are increasingly common:</p>

					<div class="mistake-card moderate">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity moderate">Moderate</span>
							<h3>Incomplete ORCiD Profile</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Linking an ORCiD iD that lacks current employment, education history, or recent works.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Researchers create ORCiD accounts but don't maintain them, or they don't understand that reviewers will check the profile.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Update your ORCiD profile before each application</li>
									<li>Ensure current and past employment is listed</li>
									<li>Link recent publications and grants</li>
									<li>Set up automatic imports from publisher databases</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="mistake-card minor">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity minor">Minor</span>
							<h3>Privacy Settings Blocking Verification</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Setting ORCiD profile to private, preventing reviewers from verifying disclosed information.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Researchers set restrictive privacy settings without realizing the impact on verification processes.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Set profile visibility to at least "trusted parties"</li>
									<li>Make employment and education publicly visible</li>
									<li>Understand the difference between public, limited, and private settings</li>
									<li>Review settings specifically before application submission</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="mistake-card critical">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity">Critical</span>
							<h3>ORCiD Doesn't Match Application Information</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>ORCiD profile shows affiliations or works not disclosed in the application, or vice versa.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>ORCiD profile and application are updated at different times, or information was added to ORCiD but forgotten on applications.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Cross-reference ORCiD profile against application disclosures</li>
									<li>Explain any apparent discrepancies proactively</li>
									<li>Update both ORCiD and applications simultaneously</li>
									<li>Use ORCiD as your master record for accuracy</li>

					<h2>Category 4: Process and Timing Errors</h2>
					<p>Sometimes the information is correct, but process mistakes cause problems:</p>

					<div class="mistake-card moderate">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity moderate">Moderate</span>
							<h3>Missing Deadlines for Updates</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Failing to update disclosures when circumstances change during the application or certification period.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Researchers don't realize that disclosure requirements are ongoing, not just at application time.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Understand update requirements and timelines</li>
									<li>Set reminders for required update periods</li>
									<li>Report material changes promptly (typically within 30 days)</li>
									<li>Don't wait for renewal to report new affiliations or support</li>

							<span class="mistake-severity minor">Minor</span>
							<h3>Submitting Too Close to Deadlines</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Waiting until the last minute to submit, leaving no time for corrections if issues are found.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Researchers underestimate application complexity or have competing priorities.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Start applications at least 4-6 weeks before deadlines</li>
									<li>Build in buffer time for unexpected issues</li>
									<li>Complete applications in stages, not all at once</li>
									<li>Have a colleague review before submission</li>

							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Not responding promptly to requests for clarification or additional documentation.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Emails go to spam, researchers are traveling, or they procrastinate on responding.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Whitelist email addresses from certifying bodies</li>
									<li>Check spam folders regularly during application periods</li>
									<li>Respond within 48-72 hours to all requests</li>
									<li>Designate a backup contact if you'll be unavailable</li>

					<h2>Category 5: Institutional Coordination Failures</h2>
					<p>Individual researchers can do everything right but still face issues due to institutional problems:</p>

					<div class="mistake-card moderate">
						<div class="mistake-header">
							<span class="mistake-severity moderate">Moderate</span>
							<h3>Conflicting Information from Institution</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Information provided by the researcher conflicts with institutional records or certifications.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-why">
								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Institutional systems aren't updated, or researcher and institution use different definitions or categories.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Verify information with your grants office before submission</li>
									<li>Ensure institutional systems have current information</li>

							<h3>Missing Required Institutional Signatures</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="mistake-body">
							<div class="mistake-example">
								<strong>The Mistake:</strong>
								<p>Submitting applications that require institutional authorization without obtaining proper signatures.</p>
							</div>

								<strong>Why It Happens:</strong>
								<p>Researchers don't realize institutional sign-off is required, or they don't allow time for the signature process.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mistake-fix">
								<strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Identify all required signatures early in the process</li>
